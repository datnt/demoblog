# Robot Toy

- I had applied object oriented programming technology by following Ruby convention. I also provide convenient and handy method to access state of ech component of robot.

- I applied TDD for developing the project

- I decided to split the controller of the robot into smaller action of each specific component. By following this design, I could provide a better hierarchy structure and more object oriented.

- I applied StateMachine class to abstract the state for each component of the robot.

- I also applied DRY technique of Ruby programming language by reuse the source code as much as possible, without repeat the same task twice, which mean avoid code duplication

- Each test case is written in a smart way that provide 1 test case for each testing scenario.

- Both Robot structure, and the test cases are simple, easy to read, easy to follow. We can run the test suit individually for specific module, or we can run the whole test suit to test the Robot on the whole.

- I also follow the coding convention of Ruby language that could be found here: https://github.com/styleguide/ruby
