Link Shortener

Objective: 

Build a small link shortener service with an API as well as a small web front-end.
- The link shortener should be able to receive a URL and give back a shortened URL.
- When a user accesses the shortened URL he should be redirected to the full URL.
- It should have a small API where you can query stats around a particular shortened URL giving you 
details about the users that have visited the URL with as much information as you can get on that person.

The application does not have to be 100% functional (but it can be if you want). 
Pseudocode is allowed as long as method names describe what the intent of the code is.

Fork this repo to your own account to start working on it.

Commit often and make your commit messages descriptive. 
I'm more interested in seeing your process than seeing the final result.

When you're done, submit a pull request with your changes.

I would suggest you start with:
- Routes the application should support
- Models and database tables (+ potentially tests)
- Controller code

Of course feel free to ask any question or clarification you might need.
Documenting your code is not required.
