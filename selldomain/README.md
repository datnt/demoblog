==========
I have converted this rubygem: https://github.com/thrivesmart/godaddy_reseller_api into a lib and make it works for Rails version 4.

Please note that Godaddy Reseller require us to perform successful all the basic actions (i.e business activity: verify domain availability, buy domain, update DNS...) which specified within the code, all the activities performed on Sandbox of Godaddy.

If all these "activities" successful, then you can move the code to work on "Production" Environment.
